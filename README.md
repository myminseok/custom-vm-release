Custom VM bosh release for customizing routes
===============

if you customized the VM network (especially under /etc/systemd/network or route) via runtime config(using os-conf release), it will be persisted in case of:
- vm is provisioned
- vm is rebooted

but it will be lost in case of follwing:
- if director vm is recreated, then bosh-agent will reset the all custom network config.
- if the custom network config files under /etc/systemd/network are deleted by any reason, it will not be restored until the os-conf job is executed via rebooting or recreating the VM.

this document explains how to customize network route config and preserve them using runtime config and custom bosh release.

eventually, all required custom config will be in bosh runtime-config file: 
```
addons:
- name: custom-vm-release-addon
  include:
    deployments:
    - p-isolation-segment-is1-6e18f0c63108927910d4
  jobs:
  - name: custom-vm-routing
    release: custom-vm-release
    properties:
      default_gw: 192.168.0.1
      check_internal: 5 
      sleep_after_updates: 10 
      routes:
      - device: eth1
        cidr: 192.4.1.0/24
        gateway: 192.168.40.1
      - device: eth1
        cidr: 192.5.1.0/24
        gateway: 192.168.40.1
```
and it will be configured to the target VM on additional config under subdirectory named after each NIC name. 
```
/etc/systemd/network/10_eth1.network.d/custom-network.conf

[Route]
Gateway=192.168.40.1
Destination=192.4.1.0/24

[Route]
Gateway=192.168.40.1
Destination=192.5.1.0/24

```

#### NOTE/Limitations 
- this release has been tested on opsman 3.x,  TAS 4.x with ubuntu jammy stemcell.
- note that this release doesn't validate the custom route config. it will just create network config under /etc/systemd/network subdirectory named after each NIC name and restart networking.
- set proper sleep_after_updates. because if the custom route config under /etc/systemd/network doesnot exist, then it will reset all custom config and restart networking.

## Command Summary

[commands.txt](commands.txt)

## Detailed steps

### (optional) Build Final Release
you can use the existing release, but you can build your own release if required. unzip this repo to any environment where bosh command is available such as ops-manager.
```
cd custom-vm-release
```
following command will build a new release under current directory.
```
bosh create-release --final --version=1.0.0
```

it will generates files under following directory: 
- dev_releases/
- releases/
- .final_builds/

you can pick a next version by listing the existing version from ./releases/custom-vm-release/.
and if there is a version conflict, you can clean up by deleting specific build version or remove the related files above.
 or delete the above folders to clean them all. 

now package a new release with specific version info locally.
```
bosh create-release releases/custom-vm-release/custom-vm-release-1.0.0.yml \
        --tarball ./custom-vm-release-1.0.0.tgz
```
### Upload release
login in to bosh env and upload the release
```
bosh env
bosh upload-release ./custom-vm-release-1.0.0.tgz
```
verify uploaded release
```
bosh releases | grep custom
custom-vm-release              	1.0.0        	23e13f4

```

note that if you run again without version, it will increase version to next patch locally. and you can clean up by deleting specific build version related files from above folder.
```
bosh create-release --final 
```

### Create runtime config
add custom route config info into runtime config, [runtimeconfig.yml](runtimeconfig.yml). refer to the NOTE section above

update runtime config and verify. optionally delete old config if need
```
bosh update-runtime-config --name=custom-vm-release-addon ./runtimeconfig.yml
bosh config --type=runtime --name=custom-vm-release-addon
bosh delete-config --type=runtime --name=custom-vm-release-addon
```

### Apply runtime config to deployment
use any existing deployment
```
bosh -d p-isolation-segment-is1-6e18f0c63108927910d4 manifest > manifest.yml
bosh -d p-isolation-segment-is1-6e18f0c63108927910d4 deploy manifest.yml
```

### Verify artifacts created on VM
then, following artifacts are created in the deployed VM

```
monit summary
...
Process 'system-metrics-agent'      running
Process 'custom-vm-routing'         running
```

```
/var/vcap/jobs/custom-vm-routing/bin
configure_routes
monitor_routes
routing_ctl
```

### Verify the applied custom network config

#### Default network config by bosh-agent.
```
/etc/systemd/network/10_eth0.network
/etc/systemd/network/10_eth1.network
```

/etc/systemd/network/10_eth0.network
```
# Generated by bosh-agent
[Match]
Name=eth0

[Address]
Address=192.168.0.76/24
Broadcast=192.168.0.255

[Network]
Gateway=192.168.0.1
DNS=192.168.0.5
```
/etc/systemd/network/10_eth1.network
```

[Address]

```

#### Verify custom network config created by this custom bosh release

```
find /etc/systemd/network

/etc/systemd/network/10_eth0.network
/etc/systemd/network/10_eth1.network
/etc/systemd/network/10_eth1.network.d
/etc/systemd/network/10_eth1.network.d/custom-network.conf
```

/etc/systemd/network/10_eth1.network.d/custom-network.conf
```
[Route]
Gateway=192.168.40.1
Destination=192.4.1.0/24

[Route]
Gateway=192.168.40.1
Destination=192.5.1.0/24

[Route]
Gateway=192.168.40.1
Destination=192.3.1.0/24
```


and route config.
```
ip route show

```

### Troubleshooting

#### Check release logs
for any reason, the custom network config file is missing, /etc/systemd/network/10_ethX_network.d/custom-network.conf, then monit `custom-vm-routing` monit kicks in and re-configure the setting by running `/var/vcap/jobs/custom-vm-routing/bin/configure_routes`
the activity is found in the log file.
```
isolated_diego_cell_is1/a4ccb2fa-af7a-48d1-b9de-1e8bb2a70be6:/var/vcap/bosh/log# tail -f /var/vcap/sys/log/custom-vm-routing/custom-vm-routing.log

```

#### removing custom network config from bosh deployed VM.
redeploy deployment by recreating VMs, otherwise existing custom config will be remained.
```
bosh delete-config --type=runtime --name=custom-vm-release-addon
bosh -d p-isolation-segment-is1-6e18f0c63108927910d4 manifest > manifest.yml
bosh -d p-isolation-segment-is1-6e18f0c63108927910d4 deploy manifest.yml --recreate
```

#### duplicated runtime config.
check if existing duplidated runtime config with this release if `bosh deploy` command fails:
```
Task 1763 | 00:52:59 | Error: Runtime manifest specifies release 'custom-vm-release' with version as '1.0.0'. This conflicts with version '1.0.1' specified in the deployment manifest.
```


### TODO
- check if the device exists in the target VM that is set in runtime config
