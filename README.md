Custom VM bosh release for customizing routes
===============
this document explains how to customize network route config using runtime config and custom bosh release.

this release supports keeping the custom routes in case of:
- vm is provisioned
- vm is rebooted
- if director vm is recreated and all customer network on bosh deployed vm will be reset by bosh-agent. this release can persist the custom network routes
- deleting the custom network config file /etc/systemd/network/10_ethX_network.d/custom-network.conf

all required custom config will be set in bosh runtime-config file. 

```
addons:
- name: custom-vm-release-addon
  include:
    deployments:
    - p-isolation-segment-is1-6e18f0c63108927910d4
  jobs:
  - name: custom-vm-routing
    release: custom-vm-release
    properties:
      default_gw: 192.168.0.1
      routes:
      - device: eth1
        cidr: 192.4.1.0/24
        gateway: 192.168.40.1
```        
and it will be configured to the target VM on additional config under subdirectory named after each NIC name.
```
/etc/systemd/network/10_eth1.network.d/custom-network.conf

[Route]
Gateway=192.168.40.1
Destination=192.4.1.0/24

[Route]
Gateway=192.168.40.1
Destination=192.5.1.0/24

[Route]
Gateway=192.168.40.1
Destination=192.3.1.0/24
```

note that, this repo has been tested in TAS 4.x on ubuntu jammy stemcell.

Usage
-----

## steps summary

```
bosh upload-release ./custom-vm-release-1.0.1.tgz

bosh update-runtime-config --name=custom-vm-release-addon ./runtimeconfig.yml

bosh config --type=runtime --name=custom-vm-release-addon

bosh -d p-isolation-segment-is1-6e18f0c63108927910d4 manifest > manifest.yml

bosh -d p-isolation-segment-is1-6e18f0c63108927910d4 deploy manifest.yml
```

## Detailed steps

### (optional) Build Final Release
you can use the existing release, but you can build your own release if required. unzip this repo to any environment where bosh command is available such as opsmanager.
```
cd custom-vm-release
```
then build release under current directory. check with existion version list from ./releases/custom-vm-release/ and pick new one.
```
bosh create-release --final --version=1.0.1
```

it will generates following files.
- dev_releases/
- releases/
- .final_builds/
to delete specific build version, remove related files above.

now package release with specific version info.
```
bosh create-release releases/custom-vm-release/custom-vm-release-1.0.1.yml \
        --tarball ./custom-vm-release-1.0.1.tgz
```
### Upload release
now login in to bosh env and upload the release
```
bosh env
bosh upload-release ./custom-vm-release-1.0.1.tgz
```
verify uploaded release
```
bosh releases | grep custom
custom-vm-release              	1.0.1        	23e13f4

```

### Create runtime config
add custom route config info into runtime config, [runtimeconfig.yml](runtimeconfig.yml)
```
releases:
- name: custom-vm-release
  version: 1.0.1

addons:
- name: custom-vm-release-addon
  include:
    deployments:
    - p-isolation-segment-is1-6e18f0c63108927910d4
  jobs:
  - name: custom-vm-routing
    release: custom-vm-release
    properties:
      default_gw: 192.168.0.1
      routes:
      - device: eth1
        cidr: 192.4.1.0/24
        gateway: 192.168.40.1
      - device: eth1
        cidr: 192.5.1.0/24
        gateway: 192.168.40.1
      - device: eth1
        cidr: 192.3.1.0/24
        gateway: 192.168.40.1
```

update runtime config and verify. optionally delete old config if need
```
bosh update-runtime-config --name=custom-vm-release-addon ./runtimeconfig.yml
bosh config --type=runtime --name=custom-vm-release-addon
bosh delete-config --type=runtime --name=custom-vm-release-addon
```


### Apply runtime config to deployment
use any existing deployment
```
bosh -d p-isolation-segment-is1-6e18f0c63108927910d4 manifest > manifest.yml
bosh -d p-isolation-segment-is1-6e18f0c63108927910d4 deploy manifest.yml
```

### Verify artifacts created on VM
then, following artifacts are created in the deployed VM

```
monit summary
...
Process 'system-metrics-agent'      running
Process 'custom-vm-routing'         running
```

```
/var/vcap/jobs/custom-vm-routing/bin
configure_routes
monitor_routes
routing_ctl
```

### Verify the applied custom network config

#### Default network config by bosh-agent.
```
/etc/systemd/network/10_eth0.network
/etc/systemd/network/10_eth1.network
```

/etc/systemd/network/10_eth0.network
```
# Generated by bosh-agent
[Match]
Name=eth0

[Address]
Address=192.168.0.76/24
Broadcast=192.168.0.255

[Network]
Gateway=192.168.0.1
DNS=192.168.0.5
```
/etc/systemd/network/10_eth1.network
```
# Generated by bosh-agent
[Match]
Name=eth1

[Address]
Address=192.168.40.11/24

[Network]
DNS=192.168.0.5
```

#### Verify custom network config created by this custom bosh release

```
find /etc/systemd/network

/etc/systemd/network/10_eth0.network
/etc/systemd/network/10_eth1.network
/etc/systemd/network/10_eth1.network.d
/etc/systemd/network/10_eth1.network.d/custom-network.conf
```

/etc/systemd/network/10_eth1.network.d/custom-network.conf
```
[Route]
Gateway=192.168.40.1
Destination=192.4.1.0/24

[Route]
Gateway=192.168.40.1
Destination=192.5.1.0/24

[Route]
Gateway=192.168.40.1
Destination=192.3.1.0/24
```


and route config.
```
ip route show

192.168.40.0/24 dev eth1 proto kernel scope link src 192.168.40.11
```

#### Check release logs/Troubleshooting
for any reason, the custom network config file is missing, /etc/systemd/network/10_ethX_network.d/custom-network.conf, then monit `custom-vm-routing` monit kicks in and re-configure the setting by running `/var/vcap/jobs/custom-vm-routing/bin/configure_routes`
the activity is found in the log file.
